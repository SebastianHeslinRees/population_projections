#' Calculate average fertility rates based on past data and assign to first
#' projection year
#'
#' Compares past rates by LA, age and sex to an input
#' curve to derive a set of scaling factors. The scaling factors are then
#' averaged or trended forward using regression. The resulting scaling
#' factor is applied to the input curve to produce a set of rates.
#'
#' @param popn String or data frame. Path to population data, or a
#'   data frame containing the data.
#' @param births String or data frame. Path to births data, or a 
#'   data frame with the data.
#' @param target_curves String or data frame. Path to the SNPP
#'   target fertility curves, or a data frame with the data.
#' @param last_data_year Numeric. The last year of births data on which to
#'   calculate averages.
#' @param n_years_to_avg Numeric. The number of years to use in calculating
#'   averages/trend forward.
#' @param avg_or_trend Character. Should the averaged be calculated as the mean
#'   \code{Average}, or by linear regression \code{Trend}.
#' @param data_col Character. The column in the \code{births} dataframe
#'   containing the rates. Defaults to \code{births}
#' @param output_col Character. The name of the column in the output dataframe
#'   containing the calculated rates
#' @param project_rate_from Numeric. The year for which a rate is being
#'   calculated. Default \code{last_data_year+1}
#' @param col_geog Character. The column containing geographic codes or names
#'
#' @return A data frame of fertility fertility rates by LA, year, sex and age
#'  with the same age structure as the target curves and overall rates scaled
#'  so that they are consistent with past births.
