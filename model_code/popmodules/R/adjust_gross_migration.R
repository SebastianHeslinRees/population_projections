#' Calculate a residual between populations and convert to gross migration flows
#'
#' A method of reconciling the difference between a population and a target
#' constraint. Rather than scaling the whole population to match, the difference
#' is used to adjust gross migration flows.
#'
#' The function calculates the difference between a population and a (lower
#' resolution) target, and then returns updated gross in- and out-migration
#' flows that include the residual.
#'
#' @param popn A data frame containing a population.
#' @param target A data frame containing a population to be constrained to.
#'   Must share column names with \code{popn} to enable a join.
#' @param col_aggregation Character vector. Names of columns to join \code{popn}
#'   to \code{target}.
#' @param inflow_df A data frame containing migration inflows.
#'  It will be scaled to include additional inflows.
#' @param outflow_df A data frame containing migration outflows.
#'  It will be scaled to include additional outflows.
#' @param col_popn A string with the name of the column containing population
#'   counts in \code{popn}
#' @param col_target A string with the name of the column containing population
#'   counts in \code{target}
#' @param col_inflow A strings with the name of the column containing inflow
#'   counts in \code{inflow_df}. Default 'dom_in'
#' @param col_outflow A strings with the name of the column containing inflow
#'   counts in \code{outflow_df}. Default 'dom_out'
#' @param rows_to_constrain A logical vector limiting the rows of \code{popn}
#'   where this function is applied. Must be all TRUE or FALSE in each grouping
#'   level specified by \code{col_aggregation}.
#'
#' @return A list of two data frames. \code{inflow} contains the input domestic
#'   inflows scaled to include the calculated positive residuals. \code{outflow}
#'   contains the input domestic outflows scaled to include the
#'   calculated negative residuals.
