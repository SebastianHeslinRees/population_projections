#' Scale a set of cross-border flows to match the totals of another
#'
#' A wrapper for \code{get_scaling_factor} which prepares origin-destination
#' flow data, constraining flows into of England to match the target data frame
#' in \code{in_constraint} and flows out of England to another the target data
#' frame in \code{out_constraint}.
#'
#' @param domestic_flow A data frame containing origin-destination flows
#' @param in_constraint A data frame containing cross-border inflow totals at
#'   the same resolution or lower.
#' @param out_constraint A data frame containing cross-border outflow totals at
#'   the same resolution or lower.
#' @param col_flow String. Name of column in \code{domestic_flow} containing

#'
#' @return A data frame of scaled domestic flows by authority, sex and single
