#' Scale births to match national totals by sex and age
#'
#' A wrapper for \code{calculate_scaling_factors} which prepares births data to
#' feed into the function and then calculates scaled births.
#'
#' Constraints are applied to sex, age and country (which is inferred from
#' gss_code), with each combination of these variables (where available)
#' constrained to the NPP national total.
#'
#' The NPP births constraint is provided for ages 15-46 while the model produces
#' births for ages 15-49. This function wrangles the input birth to bin together
#' all births from ages higher than the NPP constraints in the highest bin. (It
#' does the same for ages lower, but throws an error if it sees any because
#' there shouldn't be any.)
#'
#' @param births A data frame containing births by mother's age data.
#' @param constraint A data frame containing births data at the same
#'   resolution or lower.
#'
#' @return A data frame of scaled births by mother's year of age.
