#' Template deaths function that returns a fixed number of deaths (default zero)
#' for each aggregation level.
#'
#' This is designed to be used as a placeholder deaths function during model
#' testing and a template for other deaths functions, along with its tests.
#'
#' @param pop A data frame containing population data
#' @param col_aggregation A string giving the names of columns to which the
#'   output deaths will be aggregated to. Default \code{c("year", "gss_code",
#'   "age", "sex")}
#' @param col_popn String. Name of column with population counts. Default "popn"
#' @param const Numeric. Number of deaths to return per geography. Defaults to
#'   zero, but can be set to any positive number
#' @param error_negative_pop Logical. Throw error if deaths result in a negative
#'   population count. Setting to FALSE creates a warning instead. Default TRUE.
#'
#' @return A data frame of deaths with one row for each distinct value of the
#'   \code{col_aggregation} columns, a column named deaths with value
#'   \code{const} and a column named age with value 0.
