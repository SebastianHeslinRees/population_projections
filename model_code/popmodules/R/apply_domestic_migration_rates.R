#' Apply origin-destination migration rates to a population
#'
#' Given a cohort population and a data frame of migration rates that can be
#' joined to the population, return a data frame of origin-destination flows.
#'
#' The output data frame will use the column names of the migration dataset for
#' the origin and destination columns (if origin columns differ). This means
#' that, with default column names, the population's \code{gss_code} column will
#' be renamed to \code{gss_out}.
#'
#' The function assumes implicitly missing origin-destination flows are zero. It
#' permits zero outmigration for an entire aggregation level, and this level
#' will **not** be included in the output data frame, meaning you may need to
#' call \code{tidyr::complete} on the results (after aggregation to in/out/net
#' flows).
#'
#' The function tries to maintain tibbles, factors and grouping to match the
#' inputs, with the input population taking precedence when there is a conflict.
#'
#' The function can't yet handle migration data at a lower geographic resolution than
#' the population data (e.g. LAD migration on LSOA data), but it's on the to do list!
#'
#' Despite its fancy appearance, it's really just a little wrapper around
#' apply_rate_to_population
#'
#' @param popn A data frame containing population data.
#' @param mign_rate A data frame containing origin-destination migration at the
#'   same or coarser resolution as \code{popn}. Geographic resolutions must
#'   match, however.
#' @param col_aggregation A string or named character vector giving names of
#'   columns in \code{popn} to which the output will be aggregated, and how they
#'   join to columns in \code{mign_rate}. In particular, the mapping from the
#'   population geography to the migration origin geography columns must be
#'   specified, e.g. \code{c("year", "gss_code"="gss_out", "sex", "age")}. The
#'   destination geography and additional aggregation levels not in \code{popn}
#'   are specified in the next parameter. All elements must give columns in
#'   \code{popn} but not all need to be in \code{mign_rate}, (that is,
#'   \code{mign_rate} can be at a coarser resolution). If there is more than one
#'   geographic resolution, only specify the finest resolution common to the
#'   population data frame and the origin-destination data. Default
#'   \code{c("year", "gss_code"="gss_out", "sex", "age")}.
#' @param col_gss_destination String or character vector giving names of columns
#'   in \code{mign_rate} to which the output will be aggregated, and which
#'   weren't included in \code{col_aggregation} because \code{popn} doesn't join
#'   to them. This will usually just be \code{mign_rate}'s destination
#'   geographies. If is of length two or more you will need to specify
#'   \code{col_outflow_inflow} below. Default "gss_in".
#' @param col_popn String. Name of column in \code{popn} containing population
#'   counts. Default "popn"
#' @param col_rate String. Name of column in \code{mign_rate} containing
#'   migration rates. Default "rate"
#' @param col_flow String. Name of column to write output flows to. Default
#'   "flow".
#' @param aggregation_levels_match Logical. Passed to \code{apply_rate_to_population}. If the two
#'   input data frames cover the same domain and you expect every level of
#'   \code{mign_rate} to be matched to by a level in \code{popn} set this to
#'   TRUE, and this will be checked. Default FALSE.
#' @param many2one Logical. Passed to \code{apply_rate_to_population}. Setting to FALSE
#'   will check that no more than one level from \code{popn} matches to each
#'   level of \code{mign_rate}. Default TRUE.
#' @param col_origin_destination Character vector. Names of the origin and
#'   destination columns in \code{mign_rate}. Only required when
#'   \code{col_gss_destination} is of length two or more, though providing it
#'   (marginally) speeds things up. The code is able to infer these columns
#'   otherwise. Default NA.
#'
#' @return A data frame of origin-destination flows at the aggregation levels
#'   provided by \code{col_aggregation}.
