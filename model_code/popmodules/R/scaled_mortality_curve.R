#' Calculate average mortality probabilities based on past data and assign to
#' first projection year
#'
#' Compares past rates by LA and sex to an input
#' curve to derive a set of scaling factors. The scaling factors are then
#' averaged or trended forward using regression. The resulting scaling
#' factor is applied to the age specific input curve to produce a set of rates.
#'
#' @param popn Character. Path to the MYE population data
#' @param births Character. Path to the MYE births component data
#' @param deaths Character. Path to the MYE deaths component data
#' @param target_curves Character. Path to the SNPP target mortality curves
#' @param last_data_year numeric. The last year of death and population data on
#'   which to calculate averages.
#' @param n_years_to_avg numeric. The number of years to use in calculating
#'   averages/trending forward.
#' @param avg_or_trend Character. Should the averaged be calculated as the mean
#'   \code{Average}, or by linear regression \code{Trend}.
#' @param data_col Character. The column in the \code{deaths} dataframe containing
#'   the rates. Defaults to \code{deaths}
#' @param output_col Character. The name of the column in the output dataframe
#'   containing the calculated rates
#' @param project_rate_from Numeric. The year for which a rate is being calculated.
#'   Default \code{last_data_year+1}.
#'
#' @return A data frame of mortality probabilities rates by LA, year, sex and age
#'   with the same age structure as the target curves and overall rates scaled so
#'   that they are consistent with past deaths.
