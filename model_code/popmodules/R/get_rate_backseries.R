#' Divide a component of change by population to give historical rates
#'
#' Takes file paths to the mid year estimates for the desired component of
#' change, total population, and birth rates, and returns a data frame with
#' rates.
#'
#' The function assumes that MYE data has the standard mid-year-estimate
#' aggregation columns: \code{c("gss_code","sex","age","year")}. The component
#' file is assumed to have the same columns unless this is specified in the
#' \code{col_aggregation} parameter and with data stored in the \code{value}
#' column Note, however, that a column named "year" is currently required in all
#' input datasets.
#'
#' If the components of change data is known to be at fewer levels than the
#' population mid-year estimates, then the \code{col_partial_match} parameter
#' should name the columns where this is the case. This will be true for example
#' with fertility data, which is limited to a certain age range.
#'
#' The name of the component of change in question need not be specified if it
#' is one of these ONS default MYE components: "births", "deaths", "popn",
#' "int_in", "int_out", "int_net", "dom_in", "dom_out", "dom_net". Otherwise,
#' specify it via the \code{col_component} parameter.
#'
#' Due to the way data comparisons work, the population must be aged on as part
#' of the calculations, and the function also needs births estimates as input.
#'
#' @param component_mye_path Path to the mid-year estimates of the desired
#'   component of change.
#' @param popn_mye_path Path to population mid-year estimates.
#' @param births_mye_path Path to births mid-year estimates.
#' @param years_backseries The years for which the backseries are to be calculated. Numeric vector.
#' @param col_partial_match List of columns in \code{component_mye_path} where
#'   levels are a subset of those in \code{popn_mye_path}.
#' @param col_aggregation Vector of column names used for aggregation in the
#'   input in \code{component_mye_path}. If column names are different from MYE
#'   columns, specify the mapping from MYE to the component data with a named
#'   character vector. e.g. in origin-destination data,
#'   \code{c("gss_code"="gss_out", "gss_in")}. Default
#'   \code{c("year","gss_code","age","sex")}.
#' @param col_component String. Column name for data in the
#'   \code{component_mye_path} data frame. Need not be specified when one of
#'   "births", "deaths", "popn", "int_in", "int_out", "int_net", "dom_in",
#'   "dom_out", "dom_net".
#' @param rate_cap Numeric. Upper limits to values in the \code{col_component}
#'   column. NULL applies no limits. Default 1.
#'
#' @return A data frame containing rates for the component of change (in the
#'   "rate" column)
