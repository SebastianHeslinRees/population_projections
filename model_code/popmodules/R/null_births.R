#' Template births function that returns a fixed number of births (default zero)
#' for each aggregation level, and sets their age to zero
#'
#' This is designed to be used as a placeholder births function during model
#' testing and a template for other births functions, along with its tests.
#'
#' @param pop A data frame containing population data
#' @param col_aggregation A string giving the names of columns to which the
#'   output births will be aggregated to. Default \code{c("gss_code","sex",
#'   "age")}
#' @param const Numeric. Number of births to return per geography. Defaults to
#'   zero, but can be set to any positive number
#' @param col_age A string giving the name of the age column, if it exists in
#'   the input, or if it needs to be created for the output. It needn't be an
#'   aggregation level.
#'
#' @return A data frame of births with one row for each distinct value of the
#'   \code{col_aggregation} columns, a column named births with value
#'   \code{const} and a column named \code{col_age} with value 0.
